/*
The Fortune Teller part 2

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
- takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
*/

// write your solution here...
function tellFortune(children, partner, location, job) {
  console.log('You will be a '+ job + ' in ' + location + ', and married to ' + partner + " with " +children+ " kids.")
};
tellFortune(1, "Ricardo", "St. Louis", "Programmer");
tellFortune(2, "Ricardo", "St. Louis", "Chemical engineer");
tellFortune(3, "Ricardo", "Seattle", "Doctor");
